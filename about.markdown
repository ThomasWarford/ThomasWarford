Thomas Warford is PhD student at the University of Cambridge, focused on using artificial intelligence to accelerate materials discovery. With hands-on experience in software development, he has worked on large-scale codebases, including a recent internship at Frazer-Nash Consultancy, where the focus was on agile methodologies and maintaining both legacy and modern codebases.

Graduating with first-class honors in Physics from the University of Manchester, software development skills were honed through a masters project with Henry Pentz that earned the Tessella Prize for best use of software, out of a graduating master cohort of over a hundred students. Beyond academics and work, interests include rock climbing, running and rugby.

In a previous role at PRACE/STFC, a scalable physics-based Hamiltonian Monte Carlo implementation was developed from scratch, utilizing Python, MPI, and JAX. This work, designed to run efficiently on multi-GPU or CPU clusters with only one changed line of code, contributed towards a [conference paper at ICCS 2023](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-36030-5_49).



At the University of Manchester, as City Campus Moderator for the HORNET IT support team, he acted as the first point of contact for seven team members, helping resolve network issues for hundreds of students. Leadership roles have been taken both in academics and extracurriculars, including serving as Captain of the STEM Rugby team and helping organize an AI in Physics talk with about fifty attendants.
